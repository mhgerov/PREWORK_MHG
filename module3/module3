Number 5: "Not a Spectator Sport..."

This concept has probably been the biggest roadblock for my development. Coding feels simpler when the textbook or tutorial already breaks down the challenges into smaller tasks. Being asked write 10 different functions to give specific outputs feels less daunting then being given one open-ended assignment for one basic application. I plan on overcoming this mental block by taking a more iterative approach to problem solving. As an example, say I had to build a basic application
with a GUI interface. I would start by building a basic GUI frame that would display a simple window. From there, I'd break it down until I have small snippets to compile and test, slowly building it up. Trying to build something original can seem overwhelming, but by building one snippet at a time can be much more manageable.
