        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Dethklok is a virtual[1] death metal band featured in the Adult Swim animated television series Metalocalypse. A real band was set up in order to perform the band's music in live shows. Both bands were created by Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha. The music heard on Metalocalypse is performed by Brendon Small, with others needed for live concerts and albums. Brendon Small is set to release his second solo album, Brendon Small's Galaktikon II, which is considered to serve as "a new
        Dethklok album", due to Adult Swim holding the rights to the band name.</p>
